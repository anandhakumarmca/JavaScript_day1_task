Write a blog about objects and its internal representation in Javascript

Introduction:
	A JavaScript object is a collection of named values having state and behavior (properties and method).
For example: Person, car, pen, bike, Personal Computer , Washing Machine etc.
	Take the case of cars. All cars have the same properties, but the property values differ from car to car. All cars have the same methods, but the methods are performed at different times.
	Let’s have an example of Mercedes car and list out its properties(Features):

	Make: Mercedes 
	Model: C-Class
	Color: White
	Fuel: Diesel
	Weight: 850kg
	Mileage: 8Kmpl
	Rating: 4.5
	
	Let's see Object properties and Methods.
	
1)Objects:
	The following code assigns a simple value (Mercedes) to a variable named car:
	
	Eg in JS code:
	var car = "Mercedes";
	
	Objects are variables too. But objects can contain many values. The following code assigns many values (Mercedes, C-class, White and soo on) to a variable named Car:
	
	Eg in JS code: 
	var car = {Make: “Mercedes”, Model: “C-Class”, Color: “White”, Fuel: Diesel, Weight: “850kg”, Mileage: “8Kmpl”, Rating: 4.5};
		
	The values are written as name:value pairs (name and value separated by a colon).
	
	Syntax:
	
	Eg in JS code: 
	var <object-name> = {key1: value1, key2: value2,... keyN: valueN};
	
	So, conclusion and definition for JS objects is “JavaScript objects are containers for named values”.
	
2)Object Properties
	
	The name:values pairs (in JavaScript objects) are called properties.
	
	Eg in JS code: 
	var car = {Make: “Mercedes”, Model: “C-Class”, Color: “White”, Fuel: Diesel, Weight: “850kg”,Mileage: “8Kmpl”, Rating: 4.5};
	
	From the above snippet, let’s have a look what falls under property and property value:
	
					Property					property Value
									
					Make						Mercedes
					Model 						C-Class
					Color 						White
					Fuel 						Diesel
					Weight						850kg
					Mileage 					8Kmpl
					Rating						4.5
									
    	The object properties can be different primitive values, other objects and functions.Properties can usually be changed, added, and deleted, but some are read only.

	The syntax for adding a property to an object is :
	
	Eg in JS code: 
	ObjectName.ObjectProperty = propertyValue;
	
	The syntax for deleting a property from an object is:
	
	Eg in JS code: 
	delete ObjectName.ObjectProperty;
	
	The syntax to access a property from an object is:
	
	Eg in JS code: 
	objectName.property // Car.Make
				//or
   	objectName["property”] // Car["Make"]
				//or
	objectName[expression]	// x = "Make"; Car[x]
	
	So, Conclusion and simple definition for Java Script properties is “Properties are the values associated with a JavaScript object”.
	
3)Object Methods

	An object method is an object property containing a function definition. Let’s assume to start the car there will be a mechanical functionality.
	
	Eg in JS code: 
	function(){return ignition.on}
	
	and so similar is to stop/brake/headlights on & off, etc.
	
	So, Conclusion and simple definition for Java Script Object methods is “Methods are actions that can be performed on objects.”.
